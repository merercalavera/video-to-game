# Video to Game

A skill that teaches coding agents to turn a gameplay video into a real game you can play in the browser.
A video model designs the game (its look, camera and one memorable mechanic); the agent studies the clip frame by
frame, generates every image, 3D model and sound with fal to match it, writes the game in Three.js, then plays it
with the keyboard and films its best seconds as proof. It works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini and others.

**Play the 31 games:** [fal-video-to-game.vercel.app](https://fal-video-to-game.vercel.app)

![Video to Game: the generated video shrinks, the code and the fal assets come in, the game appears](gallery/hero.gif)

31 original games, every one rebuilt from a 10 to 15 s video generated with MiniMax H3 Max on fal: 1,013 fal calls
(594 images, 194 3D models, 290 sounds and music tracks), 202 USD in total, about 6 USD per game. Every game is a
single `index.html` with Three.js and nothing else: no engine, no template, no other library.

## Why

Agents cannot design a game's look. Asked for "a game where a boy glides between flying whales", they ship grey
boxes, a default sky and a camera that fights the player. A video model is good at exactly that part, so let it go
first, and make the agent match it:

- **The video is the design document.** `study_video.py` turns it into frames, a contact sheet, a palette and
  cut times; the agent writes a spec (camera, hero, the one mechanic, the key moment, the look) from named frames.
- **Every asset comes from fal, from the video's own frames.** Concept sheets with Nano Banana Pro, clean cutouts,
  image to 3D (Meshy, Tripo, Hunyuan 3D), rigging and animations, sound effects and music, all logged with
  `fal_asset.py`. Nothing drawn by hand, nothing downloaded.
- **The look is a spec, not polish.** Tone mapping, one grade, fog, bloom, vignette and grain from the first scene,
  and a side-by-side picture of the video and the game at the same three spots after every change.
- **Calm the world so the game reads.** One harmonized palette, dense but grouped, the hero and everything you can
  interact with standing out on a quiet background. No text on screen.
- **The agent plays its own game.** A keyboard scenario reads `window.__game` like a player reads the screen,
  `record_play.mjs` films it at the real frame rate, `best_window.py` finds the liveliest seconds. Falls, walls and
  dead seconds get fixed before anyone else plays.

## Install

**Claude Code** (plugin marketplace):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add lovisdotio/video-to-game
```

```bash
claude plugin install video-to-game@video-to-game
```

Or copy the skill: `cp -R skills/video-to-game ~/.claude/skills/`.

**Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot and other agents** (via [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)):

```bash
npx skills add lovisdotio/video-to-game
```

Or copy `skills/video-to-game` into your agent's skills folder (`~/.agents/skills/` for Codex, `~/.cursor/skills/`
for Cursor).

The scripts need Python 3.9+, ffmpeg, Node 18+ with `playwright-core` for the recorder, and
`pip install fal-client` with a `FAL_KEY` ([fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys)) for the assets.

## Use

> Turn `gameplay.mp4` into a playable browser game with the video-to-game skill. The prompt that made it is in
> `gameplay.txt`. Generate every asset with fal, match the video's look, and show me side-by-side pairs and a
> recorded take of you playing it.
